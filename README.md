## The Signal Has Found You 🌑

You’ve wandered into the domain. Coincidence? Maybe.

### Who?

- Somewhere between Sydney and Potsdam, but always moving.
- Clarkson University—Junior, if that matters. Fluent in code and sometimes the language of lights and lenses.

### What?

- I chase what calls to me, somewhere between code and chaos.
